 <h2>1. Visibility of system status:</h2>

 <p><img id="visibility-rule" src="visibility-rule.png"></p>

 <p id="text-body">The system should always keep the users informed about what is going on, through appropriate<br> 
    feedback within a reasonable time. As depicted in the image above, Google Doc users are <br>
    provided with a cloud icon that indicates the network status of their document. When changes<br> 
    are made to the document, the icon will say “saving…” to indicate it is saving the changes. <br> 
    When it is finished the icon will appear as depicted in the image above, which is a cloud icon<br> 
    with a checkmark in the center. Reassuring the user that their document is saved and won’t be<br> 
    lost when closing the application after use.<br></p>

 <h2>2. Match between the system and the real world:</h2>

 <p id="text-body">The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the<br> 
    user for effective use. In the case of Google Doc, there are many features that allow the user<br> 
    to format or adjust a document to a real-world convention that they are familiar with. As depicted<br> 
    by the images above, the user can modify the file type, language of the text, and the overall <br>
    structure or format of a body of text.<br></p>

 <h2>3. User control and freedom:</h2>

 <p><img src="user-control-rule.png" alt="user-control-and-freedom"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit”<br>
    to leave the unwanted state quickly and efficiently. Google Doc clearly supports this idea by <br>
    providing a redo and undo option in the Edit feature, which can be seen in the picture above.<br></p>
