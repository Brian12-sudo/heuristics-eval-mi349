 <h2>1. Visibility of system status:</h2>

 <p><img alt="visibility-rule" src="visibility-rule.png"></p>

 <p id="text-body">The system should always keep the users informed about what is going on, through appropriate<br> 
    feedback within a reasonable time. As depicted in the image above, Google Doc users are <br>
    provided with a cloud icon that indicates the network status of their document. When changes<br> 
    are made to the document, the icon will say “saving…” to indicate it is saving the changes. <br> 
    When it is finished the icon will appear as depicted in the image above, which is a cloud icon<br> 
    with a checkmark in the center. Reassuring the user that their document is saved and won’t be<br> 
    lost when closing the application after use.<br></p>

 <h2>2. Match between the system and the real world:</h2>
 
 <p><img src="matching-rule.png" alt="matching-rule"><img src="matching-rule-2.png" alt="matching-rule-2"><img src="matching-rule-3.png" alt="matching-rule-3"></p>
 
 <p id="text-body">The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the<br> 
    user for effective use. In the case of Google Doc, there are many features that allow the user<br> 
    to format or adjust a document to a real-world convention that they are familiar with. As depicted<br> 
    by the images above, the user can modify the file type, language of the text, and the overall <br>
    structure or format of a body of text.<br></p>

 <h2>3. User control and freedom:</h2>

 <p><img src="user-control-rule.png" alt="user-control-and-freedom"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit”<br>
    to leave the unwanted state quickly and efficiently. Google Doc clearly supports this idea by <br>
    providing a redo and undo option in the Edit feature, which can be seen in the picture above.<br></p>

 <h2>4. Consistency and standards: </h2>
 
 <p><img src="consistency-rule.png" alt="consistency-rule"><img src="consistency-rule-2.png" alt="consistency-rule-2"></p>
 
 <p id="text-body">Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions will mean the same<br> 
    thing. In the case of Google doc, this principle is clearly demonstrated in the primary tool bar.<br> 
    As depicted in the pictures above, the tool bars for Google Doc and Google Sheets are very similar<br> 
    with very similar menu options as well. This allows users to efficiently use the applications and<br> 
    increases perceived intuitiveness.<br> </p>

 <h2>5. Error prevention:</h2>

 <p><img src="error-rule.png" alt="error-rule"><img src="error-rule-2.png" alt="error-rule-2"></p>
 
 <p id="text-body">Error prevention to eliminate or reduce the potential of an error taking place, requires careful <br>
    design. With Google Doc, there are several ways in which the design helps prevent errors across the<br> 
    system. The picture on the left shows how Google prevents the user from accidentally moving a file<br>
    or doc that is already located in the “My Drive” folder. Google disables the button if the file is<br> 
    already present, and clearly indicates the button is disabled to the user. In the picture on the right,<br> 
    Google allows for search recommendations, which helps eliminate or reduce the chance of user<br>
    typos taking place.<br></p>

 <h2>6. Recognition rather than recall:</h2>

 <p><img src="recognition-rule.png" alt="recognition-rule"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Minimize the user’s memory load. In other words, make system features clearly visible so the user<br> 
    does not have to memorize information from one part of the dialogue to another. As an example, Google <br> 
    Doc previews the fonts you can pick from, instead of just the font name. As a result, the user does not<br> 
    have to remember what a certain font looks like based only on the name.<br> </p>

 <h2>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:</h2>
 
 <p><img src="flexibility-rule.png" alt="flexibility-rule"><img src="flexibility-rule-2.png" alt="flexibility-rule-2"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Catering accelerators to both experienced and inexperienced users can speed up user interaction and<br> 
    efficiency. Google Doc allows users of any experience level to tailor frequent actions by clearly listing<br> 
    the keyboard shortcuts and accelerators in grey text, as shown in the picture on the left. Additionally,<br> 
    in the picture on the right, the Help option has a Keyboard shortcuts option that takes the user to a <br> 
    designated list of shortcuts and accelerators.<br></p>

 <h2>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h2>

 <p><img src="minimal-rule.png" alt="minimal-rule"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Dialogues should not contain unnecessary information. Any unnecessary or irrelevant info can serve<br> 
    to reduce the relevance of other info and diminishes their relative visibility. For Google Doc, as expected, <br> 
    their overall outlay puts focus on the tool bar and the important functions located within the tool bar. <br>
    Additionally, as shown in the picture above, the Google Doc format allows for the user to further reduce<br> 
    information on the page if need be. <br>  </p>

 <h2>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: </h2>

 <p><img src="recovery-rule.png" alt="recovery-rule"></p>

 <p id="text-body">Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively<br> 
    suggest a solution. Google Doc does this by using red text and red indicators to show the user that a <br> 
    problem has occurred, like the one in depicted in the picture above. The error indicators are then followed<br> 
    by a “Forgot password?” prompt that guides the user to a possible solution.<br> </p>
